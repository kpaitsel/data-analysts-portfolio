Me: "could you create a data analysis masters degree level program that includes courses, projects, books, resources. The program should be free and open source.  This program should last 3 years and at the end I should be able to obtain a data analysis position easily because the program is the best you can offer at this time. Everything should focus on SQL MySQl PostgreSQL PowerBi and Tableau. Unless you predict a skill that will be above these."

GPT 4: "Certainly! I can help you create a comprehensive data analysis program that focuses on SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Power BI, and Tableau. However, please note that while I can provide you with course recommendations, books, and resources, it's important to understand that obtaining a master's degree typically involves enrollment in an accredited institution, which may incur costs.
That being said, I'll provide you with a detailed outline of the program that you can follow to enhance your data analysis skills over a three-year period. The program will include courses, projects, books, and resources to help you develop a strong foundation in data analysis. Remember, this is a suggested program, and you can customize it to suit your needs.:"

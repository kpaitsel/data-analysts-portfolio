After a few months of research, I have decided that instead of jumping straight into machine learning engineer, I am going to train/research/study/certification etc...etc...etc...for a data analysis position.
I am going to work in three specific areas: PowerBi, SQL (MySQL), and Tableau. 
From the research I have completed the past months I have been enlightened to a knowledge that I didn't understand when I started this journey: Data Analysis is the beginning level to advance to a machine learning engineer. 
It requires 3 -5 years of experience in SQL, PowerBi, and Tableau. There are other skills that are available to learn, but these are the 3 most popular as of July 2023. 
I will ask openai.com/gpt4 for some advice on how to proceed for training for each area and I will take you on my three year journey to becoming a data analysis.

The git page will serve as a portfolio and documentation throughout the three years.

Thank you for following!! 

If you have any suggestions please let me know.

Course Overview:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Database Management Systems (DBMS) and covers the fundamentals of database systems, including data modeling, normalization, indexing, and transaction management. You will gain a solid understanding of how DBMSs work, learn essential concepts and techniques for efficient data management, and develop skills to design and optimize databases.

Course Duration:
The course is designed to be completed in approximately 10 weeks, assuming a pace of 4-6 hours of study per week.

Course Objectives:

Understand the role and importance of Database Management Systems in modern applications.
Learn data modeling techniques and develop skills to design efficient and effective databases.
Gain proficiency in normalizing databases to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.
Understand indexing techniques and their impact on query performance.
Learn transaction management concepts and ensure data consistency and reliability.


Week 1: Introduction to Database Management Systems
Overview of Database Management Systems and their importance in modern applications.
Understanding the components and architecture of DBMSs.
Exploring different types of DBMSs: relational, hierarchical, network, and NoSQL.
Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL) as the standard language for interacting with DBMSs.

Week 2: Relational Data Model and Data Modeling
Understanding the relational data model and its components: tables, rows, and columns.
Exploring the entity-relationship (ER) model for data modeling.
Techniques for translating conceptual models into relational database schemas.
Identifying entities, relationships, attributes, and keys.

Week 3: Database Design and Normalization
Understanding the principles of database design and normalization.
Exploring different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and their significance.
Applying normalization techniques to eliminate data redundancy and improve database efficiency.
Normalizing sample datasets and evaluating the results.

Week 4: Indexing and Query Optimization
Understanding indexing techniques and their impact on query performance.
Exploring different types of indexes: primary, secondary, clustered, and non-clustered.
Analyzing query execution plans and optimizing queries using indexes.
